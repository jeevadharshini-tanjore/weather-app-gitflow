# 🌤️ Weather App — Git Flow Version Control Project

This is a simple Weather App built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather information for any city.

This project is built as part of a **DevOps Git Workflow demo** to showcase advanced version control practices such as:
- Feature branching
- Developing and merging to main
- Creating a release branch
- Handling hotfixes and bug fixing

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Enter city name to get current weather
- ✅ Shows temperature and condition
- ✅ Unit toggle (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
- ✅ Mobile-friendly simple UI
